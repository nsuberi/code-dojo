  your task completion as you go in the plan file. It is important      
  that you use the ai-eval-viewer as a tool to debug the code-dojo      
  main app according to the integration tests and whether or not        
  threads are correctly configured in LangSmith for the articulation    
  harness, and the harness is successfully detecting good               
  conversations and awarding gems and successfully detecting bad        
  conversations and marking topics as needs work for students. These    
  should all be done in the integration tests." --max-iterations 30

-- Generated a prompt with the below --

  Use @custom-ai-eval-viewer-plan.md to understand the path that was        
  taken for the current implementation.   

We can use integration tests within the original app's context to     
  configure the trace generation that we need for the ai-eval-viewer.   
  The ai-eval-viewer can be used to access those traces for debugging   
  the original app. This is the general workflow that i am hoping to    
  use the ai-eval-viewr for.  
 
 Add consideration for how to avoid rate-limits for LangSmith  

 When I run the ai-eval-viewer server, there are a couple of odd aspects. It          
  loads very small and I have to zoom in to view effectively. The       
  features are there, and I can see traces in the left of a feature     
  page, but when I click on it, I get errors that the thread            
  doesn't exist. I also don't see any threads in the code-dojo          
  project, I don't know if you have written the script yet to           
  interact with the application and generate the sample traces.         
  Make a plan for how to spin up the main application and create        
  sample conversations. You can use this PR submission for the          
  Flask API authentication task - include it in your plan:              
  https://github.com/nsuberi/snippet-manager-starter/pull/1. You        
  should engage in the articulation_harness conversation to have a      
  sample dialogue where the user "gets" some of the rubric items        
  correct, while persistently fails to adequately explain other         
  parts of the rubric correctly. This will simulate both "Gem"          
  acquisition and "failed understanding" conditions for stopping a      
  certain thread. If the base app needs to be updated to facilitate     
  this, that is in scope for this plan. You can use the LangSmith       
  tracing to identify when threads are being captured correctly,        
  and also use the interactions that you track in LangSmith to help     
  you make changes to the app code for the articulation_harness         
  conversation with the digi-trainer.
