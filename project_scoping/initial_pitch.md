# Problem:
I need a way to help people learn to create code and technical systems, and engage in dialogue with experts to get ideas from prototype to production and maintained in a way that is not just a bandaid on current processes, but can contribute to the meaningful evolution of the business and how work gets done.

# Appetite:
We want to spend three days demo-ing how this can be done using the Shape-up methodology, Claude Code, and Antigravity.

# Solution:
A curriculum viewing experience where you can engage with a module, see the learning goals, watch tutorial videos, try sample problems that test your ability to modify code for a specific purpose, and submit your solution for AI auto-feedback, and the ability to hear back from a teacher.

# Rabbit holes:
Need to deploy some basic infrastructure and call out the technical debt of that infrastructure, i.e. database updates and migrations, without solving for it.

# No-Gos
Building a realistic curriculum - we are scoping to a single topic - adding API authentication to a Flask driven website with basic javascript / html / css - no fancy front-end framework
Not designing this for scale - can have a site that does not stand up to high load requirement
Not integrating with other authentication tools like Google etcs
